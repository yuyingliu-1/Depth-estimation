# EndoDepth-estimation

This is the reference PyTorch implementation for training and testing depth estimation models using the method described in "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation for gastrointestinal endoscopy"

# Setup:

We have ran our experiments under CUDA 11.0, CuDNN 8.0 and Ubuntu 20.04.3. We recommend create a virtual environment with Python 3.6 using Anaconda conda create -n endodepth python=3.6 and install the dependencies as

pip3 install -r path/to/EndoDepth-estimation/requirements.txt

Install PyTorch 1.7.0 accordingly with your Cuda version (see PyTorch website for more alternatives).

pip install torch==1.7.0+cu110 torchvision==0.8.0+cu110 torchaudio==0.7.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
